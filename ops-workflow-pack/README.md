# Ops Workflow Pack

This folder contains an optional workflow pack you can install into any repo.

Included commands live under `.aynig/command/` and are intentionally minimal.
Use them as starting points and adapt to your own operating patterns.

Install from this repository:

```bash
aynig install hacknlove/all-you-need-is-git ops-workflow-pack
```
