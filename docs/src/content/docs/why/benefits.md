## Benefits

- No hidden state: every step is a commit you can inspect and review
- Simple to integrate: scripts live in the repo and run in worktrees
- Agent-agnostic: use any model or toolchain you want
- Distributed by design: branches and remotes handle coordination

## What this enables

- Reproducible runs from a known commit
- Clear handoffs between humans and agents
- Easy forking and sharing of workflow packs
