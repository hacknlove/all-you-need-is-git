title: Why AYNIG
description: Reasons to choose AYNIG for agentic workflows.
---

AYNIG is for teams who want agentic workflows without giving up control. It keeps the control plane inside Git so state, history, and intent remain visible.

## When AYNIG is a good fit

- You want a transparent, auditable workflow without external services
- Your team already relies on Git for coordination
- You need automation that can be scripted and composed

## When it might not be

- You need a hosted control plane with dashboards and webhooks
- You don't want to define your own workflow semantics and policies
- You prefer SaaS-managed state over Git history
